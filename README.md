# Hello! 👋
This is **Tawsif Torabi**. This is not my actual name, my name in the certificates is *Gazi Tawsif Turabi* So... Huh 😪
</br>
So, currently I'm studying B.Sc in CSE at **United International University**.  
I make videos on Youtube about *[Electronics Projects & Programming](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmazingVangari/)*, *[Photography](https://www.youtube.com/c/TawsifTorabi/)* and other things that I'm interested in. And I make [music](https://soundcloud.com/tawsiftorabi/tracks) too.
I don't know, why every engineer finds passion in something that is definitely not engineering.
And talking about myself, I'll just add that I'm a guy who loves his computer,  
and got someone as better-half who really hates codes. Wish me luck 🤞

Basically I like to work with Javascript, PHP, Java, C, HTML & CSS and so on. </br>
</br>
My preferable operarting system is Windows & Mac. I like Mac that doesn't mean that I've a Mac. 🙂 I've worked at a production company and they gave me a iMac 2012 as my workstation. And that was a smooth experience.
</br>
</br>
I write articles in Bangla on my own blog about programming, [faltuCoder](https://faltucoder.blogspot.com/) Faltu means dumb or worse Bengali, so I named it like that.
